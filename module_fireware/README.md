LV8548MC_Grove motor driver sensor
=================================================

A arduino example for LV8548_Grove motor driver sensor control.  
------------------------------------------------------------------  

Introduction of sensor  
----------------------  
The LV8548MC is a 2-channellow saturation voltage forward/reverse motor driver IC.It is optimal for motor druve in 12V system products and can drive either two DC motors,one DC motor using parallel connection,or it can drive a stepper motor in Full-step and Half-step.  

***
Introduction of library
-----------------------
This library contains two firewarm.
**serial_control_example** is just a independent skecth.
**Other parts** is a library for LV8548 module
***

usage:
===========  
**1、At first,What you need to know is the LV8548MC_Grove motor driver sensor module contains a LV8548 IC and a atmel-MEGA-32U4 MCU.You can also develop on the later one.**
2、Download all the source files and open serial_control_example/serial_control_example.ino in arduino IDE.
3、Then compile and download.
4、open serial_control_example/serial_control_example.ino .Select Genuino Micro as arduino board   in arduino IDE.
